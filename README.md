C++ implementation of foundamental image processing techniques

This is work done by Lychee(Li Yicheng).
Most work are done in C++ (without using OPENCV), so the code give you hint about those algorithms
each folder contains the source file and the code 
The details about algorithms are explained in the file 'compression and image processing_Liyicheng.pdf'
